# flask-to-do
Hello everyone! My name is __Ba Hoa NGUYEN (Gaben NGUYEN)__ <br>

Welcome to my first project about a todo list using __Flask, SQLAlchemy, Web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)__

Before we start, please read the note below <br>
__Note:__ Please ensure that _Flask_ and _Flask_SQLAlchemy_ have been correctly installed in your computer to run the application appropriately

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Basically, this is a simple todo web application that allows users to add and delete their tasks. However, prior to that they are asked to login first.
